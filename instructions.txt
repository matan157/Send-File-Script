To use the script you have to run the following command:
	user> python sendfile.py filename

!---- BEFORE RUNNING ----!
Make sure you edit the file to use your gmail account in the login and from
variables.

If you do not have a gmail account, either make one, or use your email's smtp
server and port. 

!---- EXTRA FUN ----!
If you're using linux, create a bin folder in your home directory.

	cd ~
	mkdir bin
	cd bin

Once you're in the bin directory, add that directory to your PATH variable.

	export PATH=$PATH:bin

Now, in this directory you can create scripts. I made one for the python
script that looks like this:

	#!/bin/bash
	python dir/sendfile.py $1

Make sure you make it executable!

	chmod 770 scriptname
